linpol diff cmp counts
=======

Model of 1.4 GHz linearly polarized differential component counts from [ATLAS DR2 Paper II](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014MNRAS.440.3113H).

The code shows how the polarized count curve is derived by convolving the Hopkins+03 total intensity differential counts with the fractional linear polarization distribution given by Equation 5 in the paper.
